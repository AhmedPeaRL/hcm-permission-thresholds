# Silence as Stability

Silence is not the absence of output.
Silence is the absence of necessity.

A stable system does not need to prove itself.
It does not signal readiness.
It does not announce coherence.

Silence is the system resting in alignment.

This repository formalizes silence
as a first-class system state.
