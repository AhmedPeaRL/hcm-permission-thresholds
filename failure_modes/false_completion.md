# False Completion

False completion occurs when a system appears ready
but no internal necessity exists.

Indicators:
- Something could be released
- Nothing needs to be released
- Silence feels sufficient

This state is dangerous only if misread.

Permission thresholds exist to recognize
that non-action here is correctness, not hesitation.
