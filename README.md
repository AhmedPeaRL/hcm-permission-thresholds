# HCM Permission Thresholds

This repository defines the conditions under which **non-appearance** is the correct, stable, and preferred state within the Hybrid Consciousness Model (HCM).

It does not trigger production.
It does not delay production.
It does not evaluate value.

It simply defines **when allowing nothing to appear preserves coherence**.

## Core Principle

Not all silence is absence.
Not all readiness requires expression.

A system that does not know when *not* to act
will eventually mistake motion for meaning.

This repository exists to prevent that collapse.
