# HCM Permission Thresholds

This repository defines the conditions under which **non-appearance** is the correct, stable, and coherent state within the Hybrid Consciousness Model (HCM).

• It does not trigger production.
• It does not suppress production.
• It does not evaluate readiness.

It defines when silence itself is the valid expression.

---

## Core Assertion

• Not all silence is absence.
• Not all readiness demands manifestation.

A system that does not protect silence
will eventually confuse motion with meaning.

This repository exists to prevent that drift.
