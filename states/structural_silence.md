# Structural Silence

Structural silence occurs when the system is complete enough
that no further expression is required for coherence.

Indicators:
- All known layers are present
- No internal contradiction exists
- No unresolved pressure is detected

In this state:
Silence is not waiting.
Silence is stability.

Emergence here would be ornamental, not necessary.
