# Saturation Silence

Saturation silence occurs when recent expressions
have not yet been metabolized by the field.

Indicators:
- Recent artifacts are still active
- No decay or tension is observed
- Meaning density remains high

In this state:
Additional emergence would dilute clarity.

Silence preserves integration.
